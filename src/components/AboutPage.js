        <h1>About Little Nest</h1>


        <p>Little Nest Preschool is a cozy, nurturing half-day program for
            preschoolers aged 2&frac12; - 5.  We have a Montessori-inspired
            environment. Our objective is to provide a balanced curriculum where
            children learn by doing and exploring and where the environment and
            experiences are in tune with the characteristics of the child.</p>

        <h2>Program Goals</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>To create a safe, supportive, and stimulating environment that
                encourages the social, emotional, physical, and mental development
                of young children through creative play.</li>

            <li>To nurture each child's sense of accomplishment and personal
                growth.</li>

            <li>To encourage families to share their unique talents, interests,
                and experiences in ways that enhance their child's class as well as
                the larger preschool community.</li>

            <li>To develop and strengthen skills in group process, mediation,
                and leadership.</li>

            <li>To foster a sense of community, support, and belonging for all
                those involved in the preschool.</li>

        </ul>
